## What Can You Find Here

This repository contains the following directories:

* [orbit-capture](orbit-capture): this directory contains the code and instructions for automating data capture in the Orbit testbed facility;
* [preprocessor](preprocessor): this directory contains the code and instructions for converting raw IQ samples from the previous step into input data ready for training or testing the fingerprinting method;
* [fingerprinting](fingerprinting): this directory contains our code for training the fingerprint extractor model, testing its performance and producing figures which we included in our paper.

## Requirements

For this project, you will need both Python and Matlab environments on your machine. The latest Matlab (R2024a at the time of writing) can be downloaded [here](https://www.mathworks.com/help/install/ug/install-products-with-internet-connection.html). As for Python, consider using [Conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html).

Specific requirements w.r.t. particular modules of this project can be found in corresponding subdirectories.

## That's all, folks!
